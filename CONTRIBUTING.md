## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes

* Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Adopt your theme to Visual Studio Code

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.
